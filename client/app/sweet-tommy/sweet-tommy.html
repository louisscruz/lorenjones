    <p><b>Sweet Tommy</b> was a five piece folk, rock, punk, party band that became one of the top San Francisco bands of 1980. We played with bands like the Dead Kennedys, the Mutants and Flipper, and had a huge following, eventually becoming the last in-house band at The Palms, where the Tubes and several other major bands made their debut. A mutual friend exposed Sweet Tommy to Iggy Pop and we became Iggy’s favorite band.  Our show included many props, an exploding robot, a foam dinosaur and a full size cardboard car with a mannequin passenger.</p>
    <p>On keyboards, accordion and vocals - Loren Jones,  on guitar and vocals - Tommy Cullinen, on bass and vocals - Ezra Palmer-Person and later Ruben Sequenza, drummer - Barry McKinley, and guitarist, writer, arranger, singer - Dan Christy.  We produced an eight song, double EP record and created a thousand numbered, original, hand-painted covers, each different and unique.  Between 1979 and 1981 we wrote and performed over 160 original tunes in over 350 gigs in and around San Francisco.  It was a blast.</p>
