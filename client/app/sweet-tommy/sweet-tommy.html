    <p><b>Sweet Tommy</b> was a five piece folk, rock, punk, party band that became one of the top San Francisco bands of 1980. We played with bands like the Dead Kennedys, the Mutants and Flipper, and had a huge following, eventually becoming the last in-house band at The Palms, where the Tubes and several other major bands made their debut. A mutual friend exposed Sweet Tommy to Iggy Pop and we became Iggy’s favorite band.  Our show included many props, an exploding robot, a foam dinosaur and a full size cardboard car with a mannequin passenger.</p>
    <p>My band’s line up included me writing, creating props, singing, playing keyboards and accordion, lead singer, Tommy Cullinen, Ezra Palmer-Person and later Ruben Sequenza, who wrote and sang as well, drummer Barry Mickinley, and Dan Christy adding his writing, arranging, singing and incredible guitar work.  We produced an eight song, double EP record and created a thousand custom painted covers, all different. We performed 160 original tunes in over 350 gigs in and around San Francisco. It was a blast.</p>
