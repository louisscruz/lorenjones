    <h1>Sweet Tommy</h1>
    <p>Sweet Tommy was a five piece folk, rock, punk, party band that climbed up the San Francisco club scene between 1979 and 1981. We played with bands like the Dead Kennedys, The Mutants and Flipper, and had a huge following, eventually becoming the last house band at The Palms, where The Tubes several other major bands made their debut. We performed one hundred sixty original tunes in over two hundred fifty gigs in and around San Francisco. We had many props, an exploding robot, a foam dinosaur and a cardboard car with a mannequin passenger. Our lead singer, Tommy Cullenin, was a prolific songwriter and wild performer. Our bass players, Ezra Palmer-Person, and later Ruben Sequenza, along with drummer Barry Mickinley, were talented musicians and song writers as well. With Dan Christy adding his writing, arranging and incredible guitar work, we produced many recordings, including an eight song, double EP record, and created a thousand custom painted covers, all different, and made a Science fiction film which we often showed before performances. It was a blast.</p>
