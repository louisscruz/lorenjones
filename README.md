This is the website for Loren Jones' music.

## Development

### Setup

This is a pretty basic Gatsby website.

Run `nvm use` to ensure you're running the right version of Node.

You should just have to run `yarn` to install all the necessary dependencies.

### Environment Variables

You'll need to populate the environment to get this running.

```sh
mv ./.env.example.js ./.env.js
```

Then, make sure you fill in the appropriate values.

### Run

At this point, you should be able to do a `yarn start`.
